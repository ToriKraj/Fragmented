# About Fragmented
Fragmented is a virtual reality experience of the album LPI by FKA Twigs. It remixes the cover art of the album by fragmenting traces of the face and superimposing photos of victims of unjust police violence onto each fragment. This concept was inspired by the work of Adrian Brandon (https://www.instagram.com/ayy.bee/?igshid=133uumhjf6246) who published a series of partially painted faces of black people who lost their lives due to the outcome of racial violence. He worked on each painting one minute for each year of their lives, leaving viewers with an abruptly incomplete final product and feeling solemn about why these people's lives were taken in such haste. As we developed our concept, we focused on ontological narration and brainstormed ways that we could evoke a similar story through the album art. In this case, we gave function to an existing form, transforming a 2D image into 3D space, and created an experience where users could be fully immersed in the artwork. The goal of our final design is to highlight the stories of these victims and serve as a reminder to all people that our society still has a long way to go in the battle towards racial equality and justice.
